# Using-JavaScript-to-access-Relational-Databases-online

This repository includes a JavaScript script that connects to the University of California - Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Databases at: https://genome.ucsc.edu/  To get online training on these databases go to:  https://genome.ucsc.edu/training/  

This repository also includes JavaScripts to connect to and obtain data from other online relational databases such as the City of Baltimore Traffic Camera database and the City of Baltimore Crime Statistics database.

Note that I use node.js to run the JavaScript scripts rather than running them in a browser.
